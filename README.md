# Python Projects Repository

Welcome to my Python projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects I've built while learning Python, including games, data processing scripts, and GUI applications.

## Projects

### Games
- **Blackjack**: A command-line blackjack game where the player competes against the dealer.
- **Coffee Machine**: A simulation of a coffee vending machine with menu options and resource management.
- **Hangman**: A word-guessing game where players attempt to guess letters before running out of attempts.
- **Higher or Lower**: A guessing game where players determine whether the next value is higher or lower.
- **Number Guesser**: A simple game where the computer selects a random number and the player tries to guess it.
- **Quiz Game**: A multiple-choice quiz game that presents questions and tracks scores.

### Data Processing & Utility Projects
- **Pandas Data Processing**: Scripts utilizing the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Merging Mail with File Path**: Automates the merging of mail documents using file paths.
- **NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter**: A program that converts user input into NATO phonetic alphabet.

### GUI & Graphics-Based Projects
- **Tkinter GUI Applications**: Various projects that use Tkinter to create graphical user interfaces.
- **Turtle Graphics Projects**: Programs that use Python's Turtle module for creative drawing and animations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Tkinter**
- **Turtle**

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd python-projects
   ```
3. Run the desired Python script:
   ```sh
   python script_name.py
   ```

## Future Improvements
- Adding more GUI-based projects
- Enhancing game logic with AI techniques
- Expanding data processing projects with real-world datasets
